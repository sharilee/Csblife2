“I have received, my God, so many blessings from you.” 

My reflection to this quote is that I have so many things that I received from God and all the blessings that He gave me is very special. I thought that we received many blessing from Him but we do not value the things He gave us. He who gave us so many blessings means that He cherish us so much that he gave His everything to us. This quote is also saying that we have received His blessing but He is not asking for something for us in return. He who always care for us always give us blessings that we could treasure like our parents God gave us out parents because He know that our parents would care for us and take care for us. Friends, He also gave us this so that we could know each other and share each other’s problems and get to know each other. I am very thankful that He gave us so many blessings and He always is there in our time of need and He will always guide us in our problem and we can always pray to let Him know that we are grateful for the things He have done.
